And I think another thing that's really important is education, because I think a big part of income inequality comes from the lack of education and the lack of resources from a young age, and that grows over time. So, opening more schools, opening more educational programs that are free and of high quality, with access to things like computers and resource help 24-7, I think that would be really, really cool."

There's so many things that you can do, you don't have to be great at all of them, but I think because for people younger than me, they're still children and they're still trying to explore their interests, you shouldn't just lock into one thing and believe that that's the path that you want to go into.
