Because I feel like people have really good ideas, but in our generation, it's kind of hard to see that you are actually capable of achieving them. And through social media, for example, we're encouraged to stop trying, because since everything is given to us and our minds are going numb because of all of the social media stuff, I feel like we have to be encouraged to act and to see the value in acting, because there's lots of problems in the world. And I don't see a specific one that should be prioritized before the other ones. For example, climate change is something I'm really worried about, but there's lots of other problems. So something that helps people with ideas solve these problems, because we need new ways to solve them."

        "content": "I think that young people should have the resources to achieve their ideas, but the main point would be to actually encourage them emotionally and just support them to stop being numb to the world and actually like waking up their inner curiosity and ambition to do something with their lives and we're seeing the problems and it's kind of, we have a fatalistic view, so just like making young people see that there's things to do, we can do stuff to change the world, like it's not all hope, it's lost, and then that they can be the ones who help change this. We're giving inspirational speeches, but I feel like some different discourse is needed."

        "content": "I think that the main point to achieve a fulfilling life is not what you do in terms of the education you get, the job you get, the money you earn. I think it's more of a perspective thing, so just like to live a fulfilling life one should be in tune with their emotions and with their surroundings and with their own experiences, not trying to block some stuff, not trying to block these negative emotions, just like prioritizing, getting to know oneself better and getting to grow. And from this I feel like everything, everything else comes derived from actually understanding oneself, understanding how one wants to improve, what one wants to do with their lives up to the point where they feel fulfilled. I don't want it to be like a race to actually try to catch this happiness and just like achieving a bunch of stuff that is actually meaningless to one because they think that money will make life more fulfilling, but instead of this trying to find what their emotions or what their actual self wants to achieve and what's actually good for them. And having a good moral base is really important for that and this comes through self perfection, so I think that's the first step and like the step that has to be maintained throughout all of life to actually have a fulfilling life. It doesn't relate that much to the education you get, where you get it, the money you get, it's a whole different topic."

And so I spend this time thinking. And this has led me to, well, my mom really prioritizes moral values, and she has like encouraged me to see being a good person as my main trait and as a main trait that a person should have. And so now it's what I look for in other people and where I try to achieve myself. I still think I'm not a good person. I still like find lots of lags in my actions and in the establishment of my values. And that's something that kind of would be my main fear and what makes me anxious, mainly because I see that I act badly every day. But I still try and I still feel like I'm improving sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I don't. But I guess I'm still like, at least I'm conscious about it. I don't know any specific experiences and something that like specifically made me realize it. But I feel like the way I grew up and now the way I maintain this mentality through like spending time thinking every day. And right now at RSI, I can't really do it. But back at home, like I prioritize going on walks with my phone turned off just to think about my actions that day. And sometimes it's hard. Sometimes I cry. But at least I know what's going on and I'm conscious of my own life, which I think it's really important."

For example, the other day I was with someone and we started talking about other people and this person just stopped the conversation, stopped participating in it because they said that they didn't want to gossip. And it wasn't something I actually was considering to be gossiping, but I feel like that was a really strong way to act because that person didn't even know me that well and having the willingness, the strength to do so in front of people you don't really know that much, I do it sometimes, but maybe seeing it in someone external is really impressive to me. And not only with close people that I admire, but also with celebrities, no not celebrities because you can't really get to know them, but important people I mainly prioritize this. And I see myself wanting to be friends with some specific people and the pattern I see is that they are usually highly intelligent people, amazing people, and they all are good people with noticeable moral bases that I find really, really, really admirable."

Just like putting down other people, which I don't do very exaggeratedly, but there are some nuanced ways I act that I feel like kind of lead me to this, and I don't like it at all. And this is both, putting people down and then lying about myself, which is something I usually get the thought to do so, and I find it really annoying for myself, and I'm really trying to beat it."

In a collaborative setting, it could be, I don't really know. If I'm short on time, I end up like working alone in a task, like after discussing it collaboratively, because if I really have to rush, it's better for me.
